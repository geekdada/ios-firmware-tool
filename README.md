iOS Firmware Tool
=================

A web app for easily downloading iOS firmwares.

Feel free to use the [firmware database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geekdada/ios-firmware-tool/master/app/views/firmware.json). It contains the newest version of iOS firmwares but not all firmwares and it won't matter because you can't use outdated firmware to restore anyway.

The newest version is iOS `7.1.1`.
